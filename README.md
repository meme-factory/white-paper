# Meme Factory White Paper

MEME-Factory was born to create the perfect ecosystem for meme coin lovers and their creators.

The MEME-Factory ecosystem is designed for community members to make the most of meme coins.
Within the platform, without writing any code, any user can create his latest generation MEME coin by paying a FEE and entering the necessary data.
Once the perfect MEME coin has been created, with a few simple clicks, a pool can be started to allow exchanges and allow users to enter liquidity.

All this thanks to the use of the MEME-COIN, the token that will act as fuel for the whole ecosystem.
In fact, every time a new MEME Coin is created on the platform, a fee in MEME-Coin must be paid and all the Liquidity Pools opened on the MEME-Factory will have the MEME-COIN as countervalue.

The fees thus generated will be redistributed to all the stakers and Liquidity providers of the online platform.

The token economy and road map will be online soon.
